# es6-babel-gulp-practice
Practice directory for the following technologies: es6, babel, gulp, mocha, es7 async/await, browserify. Eventually will include redux. 

This is mainly because I'm having a bit of trouble getting ES7's async/await syntax to work.  I'd rather test it before I start using it in production.
